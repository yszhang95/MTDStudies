1. fillMatchNtuple.C selects those matched and unswap D0 candidates, fillMatchSwapNtuple fill those swap candidates

2. mtdAcceptance.C 

3. invBetaPlot gives QA plots and study the RMS value of (1/beta - 1/beta_expected) vs P

4. calSig.C gives significance calculation

5. fillGen.C gives genPt.root, the histograms used for sig calculation

6. hyjetMass.C fill mass histograms used for sig calculation

7. promptD0mass.C fill mass histograms used for sig calculation

8. myAna.h stores consts used in each macro

# calculate significance vs y in bins of pt
1. fillPromptDMass fills Mass vs Pt and Y into a TH3F object, project it to z axis with different range of y and pT would give the yield.
2. fillHyJetsMass fills Mass vs Pt and Y into a TH3F object,
3. calSigAll.C calculate the significance, it project TH3F to z axis to get the yield, one can calculate significance of any range of pT.
4. residual of diff_1/beta at low p calculation is defined in myAna.h,
   also, some other common function for prompt d0 and hyjets samples are defined in myAna.h,
   class PromptD and class HyJets are derived from class D0Cand, it should be more convenient to modify any definition in myAna.h
5. topological cuts optimization could be done straightforward

   one can define a new TH3 Object like Mass Vs Pt and Y, 

   and fill the TH3 object when candidate mass is in mass windows, (FWHM)

   then like mass vs pt and y, project the histograms into the range from cutMin to cutMax, to calculate the significance

# TODO
   LambdaC/D0 ratio vs pT in |y|<1, 1<|y|<2, 2<|y| < 3

   LamdaC and D0 v2 vs pT for |y| < 3

   D0 and D0bar v1 and v2 integrate over full pT>0, for every 1 unit y bin from -3 to 3

   combine negative and positive if we need to separate them, we just devided by sqrt(2)

   combine 1-1.5 and 1.5-2 into 1-2, in pT

   increase signal yield by 1.1
